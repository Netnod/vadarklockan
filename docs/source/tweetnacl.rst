tweetnacl - tiny crypto library
===============================

Vad Ã¤r klockan relies on TweetNaCl for the implementation of the
ed2556 and sha512 cryptographic primitives.

From https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/:

TweetNaCl is the world's first auditable high-security cryptographic
library. TweetNaCl fits into just 100 tweets while supporting all 25
of the C NaCl functions used by applications. TweetNaCl is a
self-contained public-domain C library, so it can easily be integrated
into applications.
